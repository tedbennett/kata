# Language Learning

This app will be an Anki-style language flashcard app. Instead of giving an indication of how well you remember the word on the front of the flashcard (e.g "Fail, Hard, Easy"), you must instead correctly type out the reverse of the card. I find this not only helps to reinforce learning, but for languages with a non-Qwerty keyboard (e.g Korean, Japanese), it helps gain familiarity with the keyboard and builds typing skills.

For first draft, a simple algorithm for words-to-review will be used and decks can be created in-app or imported from a .csv file. Hopefully in the future a more advanced Anki-like algorithm can be implemented as well as using the .apkg format.
